# Vimo

## Description

Website for personal website building business started by Jennifer Kim and myself. Here users can learn about the services we offer, view our credentials, and contact us to schedule a consultation. We chose a simple design to highlight our own brand, which was inspired by industrialism and manufacturing lines, because we are driven by the importance of showcasing a company's brand on their website.

## About the Company

Vimo was started as a side project after the completion of the University of Oregon's Coding Boot Camp, in an effort to build a personal brand and company. Our dream is to make websites for companies that have strong brands and wish to create a unique experience for their users. We also dream of extending our services to offer assistance with branding, i.e. logo design, slogan creation, color pallete redesign, social media marketing, professional development, and more.
